# Performance history data set of the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, 1967-2017

A transformation of the data is available in beta mode at https://openmusiclibrary.org/events/archive/baltimore/


Data was harvested from two databases maintained by the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra: ArtsVision (1996-present) and a legacy system (1967-2009). 

In 2018-2019, interns and Peabody Archives staff normalized names and dates in Excel and OpenRefine, added columns for name authority IDs according to VIAF.org, and removed duplicate entries. Discrepancies and missing entries were checked against BSO programs.
